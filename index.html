          <h1>The Road Not Taken</h1>
          <h2>by Robert Frost</h2>
          <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
          Robert Frost poetAnd sorry I could not travel both<br>
          And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
          And looked down one as far as I could<br>
          To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>
          <br>
          Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
          And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
          Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
          Though as for that the passing there<br>
          Had worn them really about the same,<br>
          <br>
          And both that morning equally lay<br>
          In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
          Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
          Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
          I doubted if I should ever come back.<br>
          <br>
          I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>
          Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>
          Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”<br>
          I took the one less traveled by,<br>
          And that has made all the difference.<br>
